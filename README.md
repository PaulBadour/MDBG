A digitized version of the board game Marvel Legendary, a deck building board game built in Godot

I like playing the Tabletop Simulator Version of this game, but there were a few quirks about the scripting that bothered me.
It would have been a lot faster to write the Lua code necessary to fix that, but I decided to take it up a notch and recreate the whole game
